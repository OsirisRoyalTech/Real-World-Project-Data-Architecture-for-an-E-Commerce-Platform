# Real World Project: Data Architecture for an E-Commerce Platform
In this project, we will design the data architecture for a multi-channel e-commerce platform that manages product inventory, customer data, and transactions. The platform serves as a marketplace for multiple vendors, and the goal is to design a scalable, efficient, and secure architecture to handle both the operational and analytical needs of the platform.

# Project Problem
Business Context<br /><br />
The e-commerce platform needs to integrate data from different sources:<br />
  •	Customer data: Personal information, preferences, and purchase history.<br />
  •	Product data: Catalog details, price, availability, and vendor information.<br />
  •	Transaction data: Order details, payment status, shipping information.

The platform must support real-time interactions (e.g., order placement) while enabling complex analytical queries (e.g., sales analysis, inventory forecasting).
Challenges:<br />
  •	Scalability: The platform needs to scale to handle millions of transactions and users.<br />
  •	Data consistency: Ensuring accurate, consistent data across the entire system.<br />
  •	Performance: Enabling fast and efficient querying for both operational and analytical purposes.<br />
  •	Security: Ensuring sensitive data (e.g., payment details, customer information) is handled securely and compliantly.<br />
  •	Multi-Channel Integration: Integrating data from both the online platform and physical stores.

# Project Solution
Architecture Overview<br /><br />

1.	Database Design:<br />
o	We’ll use a hybrid architecture: <br />
&ensp;	Relational Databases (RDBMS): For transactional data such as customer orders, payments, and inventory (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).<br />
&ensp;	Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL): For product catalogs, user activity logs, and other semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB).<br />
&ensp;	Data Warehouse: For analytical queries, aggregating data across the platform and enabling business intelligence reporting (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery).<br />
&ensp;	Data Lake: Store raw, unstructured data such as customer feedback, logs, and images in a Data Lake (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).<br />

2.	ETL Pipeline:<br />
o	Extract data from transactional systems and other sources.<br />
o	Transform the data (data cleansing, aggregation).<br />
o	Load the transformed data into the Data Warehouse.<br />

3.	Data Access Layer:<br />
o	The data access layer will provide APIs to interact with data from the relational, NoSQL, and Data Warehouse systems.<br />

4.	Security and Compliance:<br />
o	Implement encryption (SSL/TLS) for data in transit and AES-256 encryption for data at rest.<br />
o	Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.<br />
o	GDPR and PCI-DSS compliance for handling customer and payment data.<br />
